# AI-ML-
This repository showcases my journey to becoming a skilled AI/ML Engineer — continuously learning, experimenting, and turning data into intelligence.

Welcome to my AI & Machine Learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my continuous learning, experiments, and project implementations in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. As AI continues to redefine industries across the world, this repository represents my effort to build strong foundational skills, solve real-world problems, and contribute to innovative, data-driven solutions.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to explore the full pipeline of machine learning — from data preprocessing to model deployment. Each project and notebook reflects hands-on learning, experimentation with algorithms, performance evaluation, and optimization techniques. This will help me develop strong analytical thinking, coding skills, and a professional AI portfolio for future opportunities in the domain.
